             <h3>a little bit about me</h3>
             <p>I'm an aspiring web developer - looking for a place where I can expand my career. 
                When I'm not studying I enjoy spending my time outdoors - ATV'ing, snowmobiling, reading a book or working out.
                I would love to be a competitive powerlifter (in a different life without back pain), but I do enjoy Yoga to keep me grounded.
                I have two dogs that usually keep me company while I work. If I'm not listening to music I usually have a true crime podcast playing. 
             </p>

        <h3>Enjoy some Star Wars Ipsum while I put things together</h3>

        The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. 
        The target area is only two meters wide. It’s a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. 
        The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station.
         Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is ray-shielded, so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes. 
         That’s impossible, even for a computer. It’s not impossible. I used to bull’s-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. 
         They’re not much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!
